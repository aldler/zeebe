   * The following methods deal with time. "Time" here means a logical scheduled execution time.
   * (The actual execution time may differ from the scheduled times.)
   *
   * To summarize, we distinguish the following points in time:
   * _scheduledActivationTime_ this is the time when a BPMN element is activated.
   *
   * An element might be activated, but its execution step(s) might be scheduled later.
   * E.g. a parallel gateway will activate 2 or more elements, but only once of them will be executed
   * next. The others are executed later. This is captured in
   *
   * _scheduledExecutionStartTime_ this is the time when an execution step will be executed.
   *
   * _deltaTime_ the time the execution step will take
   *
   * _scheduledExecutionEndTime_ this is the time when the execution of a step is finished.
   *
   * Distinguishing the activation vs. the execution time is important for calculating correct
   * values for timeouts.
   *
   * For a broader discussion, please consult https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/issues/6568
   * which discusses the problem and the concept.
